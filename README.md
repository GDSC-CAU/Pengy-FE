## UN's Sustainable Development 
### Goal 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities

### Solution
In modern society, many fire-related issues arise due to ignorance and carelessness. Our app aims to address these problems by introducing a highly unique approach to space management.

To tackle this issue, we have structured the app around managing one's space. The main functionality of the app is to construct one's space and place various objects within it.

During this process, we identify objects that pose a fire hazard for placement. Through this, users must use the camera to identify and register objects with fire hazards while constructing their space. In doing so, users become aware of fire-hazardous objects and receive information about the various problems associated with them and their solutions. Based on the provided solutions, users' perception shifts from ignorance to awareness and preparedness.
